This year for my birthday, I thought it would be a fun to host a mustard party.

What's a mustard party you ask? Well, Beth and I will provide as many pretzels as we can acquire.

- Soft Pretzels
- Sourdough Pretzels
- Butter Spindles
- Pretzel Sticks
- Pretzel Rods
- Pretzel Twists

and probably some bratwurst.

As guests, we ask that you supply the mustard.

Hopefully, this will be an opportunity for us all to try that mustard we have had our eye on but didn't want to go out on a limb to buy.

Where: The Mashton Manor (1201 Buchanan St NE)

When: January 27th, 2018 8:00 pm
